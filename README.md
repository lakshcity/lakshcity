- 👋 Hi, I’m @lakshcity
- 👀 I’m deeply interested in exploring the potential of technology to revolutionize education, particularly through open-source hardware and software. I'm fascinated by the maker movement and its ability to empower learners of all ages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about integrating AI and machine learning concepts into educational tools and exploring advanced applications of Python in embedded systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source educational projects that leverage platforms like Raspberry Pi, focusing on creating engaging and accessible learning experiences. I'm also keen on contributing to initiatives that promote digital literacy and computational thinking.
- 📫 You can reach me through my GitHub profile or feel free to connect on LinkedIn (let me know if you'd like me to share the link!).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: You can often find me tinkering with single-board computers late into the night, fueled by chai!
