- 👋 Hi, I’m @lakshcity
- 👀 I’m deeply interested in exploring the potential of technology to revolutionize education, particularly through open-source hardware and software. I'm fascinated by the maker movement and its ability to empower learners of all ages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about integrating AI and machine learning concepts into educational tools and exploring advanced applications of Python in embedded systems.

- ⚡ Fun fact: You can often find me tinkering with single-board computers late into the night, fueled by chai!
