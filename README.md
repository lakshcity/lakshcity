- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lakshcity
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m deeply interested in exploring the potential of technology to revolutionize education, particularly through open-source hardware and software. I'm fascinated by the maker movement and its ability to empower learners of all ages.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about integrating AI and machine learning concepts into educational tools and exploring advanced applications of Python in embedded systems.

- âš¡ Fun fact: You can often find me tinkering with my gaming console late into the night, fueled by chai!
